# Data Managment Plan

## Data description
The scope of this thesis project includes conducting whole genome sequencing of bacterial DNA in order to determine phylogeny within the sample set, or relatedness between the samples. This sample set consists of unique samples of a particular food borne pathogen group that was gathered from produce processing facilities across the pacific northwest. 

The project will consist of DNA sequence data with files that include sequences (nucleotide bp represented as ATCG), as well as information about those sequences (such as length, quality, G/C content). During the project the data will move through data processing and as it does so the changed data will be maintained separately from the data in the previous step. In some of the subsequent steps data sets will contain graphs and charts in addition to the sequences. The data is experimentally obtained from non-human subjects. An additional aspect of this data is the meta data that goes along with the sequencing information. This includes where the samples were collected from, how they were collected, what exactly they are, as well as experimental profiles for antimicrobial resistance. I expect to maintain roughly 20 GB of data within each dataset during the course of this project. 

## Roles and Responsibilities 
Due to the large size of the data sets, the management of this data must be a collective and collaborative effort within the lab group. The PI, and advisor of this project implemented the data management plan as part of the grant that is funding the work we are conducting. As the PI of the project, she also acts as the main manager of the data responsible for sharing the data upon completion of the project in the appropriate online database. As the only graduate student in my lab I am responsible for the collection and generation of the data we will be working with. Data generation is conducted with the help of the Center for Genomic Research and Bioinformatic (CGRB) at Oregon State University, Corvallis OR, who generated the genetic sequences on their next generation sequencing machines. Data analysis will be a collective effort between myself, my PI and a Post-doctoral researcher. Once I finish up with my work on the data set the next incoming graduate student will take over this data. In the case that there is not an incoming graduate student or there is a new project at the time I complete my masters, the postdoctoral researcher will take over my data. 

## Data standards and metadata
## Storage and security

Data will be stored on private file servers held at the Center for Genomic Research and Bioinformatics (CGRB) at Oregon State University, Corvallis OR.

## Access and data sharing
The data set I will be working with is not sensitive or confidential. It is not human subject data in any capacity, and the release of the data onto online platforms can be done freely without permission by the university or limiting the identifying information. In fact, the sharing of my data with significant meta data onto online platforms is essential in advancing the research being done in this field of bacterial genetics. You need robust databases to search against in order to understand what you are working with as a researcher.
