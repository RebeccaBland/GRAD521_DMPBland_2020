This is a data managment plan for Genomic Analysis of Listeria spp.

Context of the Project:

The scope of this thesis project includes conducting whole genome sequencing of bacterial DNA in order to determine phylogeny within the sample set, or relatedness between the samples. This sample set consists of unique samples of a particular food borne pathogen group that was gathered from produce processing facilities across the pacific northwest. 

This project will consist of DNA sequence data with files that include sequences (nucleotide bp represented as ATCG), as well as information about those sequences (such as length, quality, G/C content). During this project the data will move through data processing and as it does so the changed data will be maintained separately from the data in the previous step. In some of the subsequent steps data sets will contain graphs and charts in addition to the sequences. The data that I will be working with is experimentally obtained. An additional aspect of this data is the meta data that goes along with the sequencing information. This includes where the samples were collected from, how they were collected, what exactly they are, as well as experimental profiles for antimicrobial resistance. I expect to maintain roughly 20 GB of data within each dataset during the course of this project.
